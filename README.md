# Skyrim AI Companion Mod

## Overview
This project aims to create an advanced AI-powered companion for Skyrim using modern machine learning frameworks. The companion will intelligently interact with the player, make decisions in combat, and adapt to different playstyles.

## Features
- **AI Decision Making**: The companion will use reinforcement learning to make combat and survival decisions.
- **SKSE Integration**: A custom SKSE plugin will extract game state data.
- **Machine Learning**: The AI model will be trained using PyTorch/Stable-Baselines3.
- **Modular Design**: The AI logic will be separate from the game logic to allow future expansion.

## How It Works
1. **Game State Extraction** - The SKSE plugin gathers real-time data (player health, enemy positions, etc.).
2. **AI Processing** - The data is sent to a machine learning model, which decides the best action.
3. **Game Execution** - The AI decision is sent back to Skyrim and executed via scripts.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- **Skyrim Special/Anniversary Edition**
- **SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender)**
- **Visual Studio + CommonLibSSE** (for plugin development)
- **Python + PyTorch** (for AI training)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB/skyrim-ai-companion.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (Python & SKSE plugin tools).
3. Run the SKSE plugin to extract game state.
4. Train the AI model using provided scripts.
5. Launch Skyrim and test the AI-driven companion.
